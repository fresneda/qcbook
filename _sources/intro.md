# Topics in Quantum Computing

This is a collection of algorithms written in Qiskit and filled with
a little bit more mathematical detail than one usually finds online.

I generally find that the online material lack some mathematical clarity. 
I use the qubit-ordering convention adopted by Qiskit (little-endian), as opposed to what one would find in the literature, so that it is easier to write programs in Qiskit. I hope it helps!
